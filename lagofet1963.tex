We take up some of these questions here.Notation: $F_R$ -- all compact $C^2$ $n$-dimensional surfacescontained in $E^{n+1}, n \ge 2$, with principal radii of curvatureall $\ge R$. \cite{L1,L2,L3,L4}; let $$\kappa(F_R) = \inf \{\rho : \textrm{ there is a ball of radius }\rho \textrm{ interior to a surface in } F_R\}.$$It was shown that $\kappa (F_R) = \kappa_0R$, where $\kappa_0 =2/\sqrt 3 -1 \cong 0.155$.The sharpness of this bound was shown by constructing examplesof surfaces $F_{(\epsilon)} \in F_R$, containing spheres of radii$\kappa_0R+\epsilon$, for $\epsilon > 0$ arbitrarily small. Thesurfaces $F_{(\epsilon)}$ have nonzero Betti numbers and bounda body of complicated topological structure; precisely,$F_{(\epsilon)}$ is homeomorphic to a boundary $S^n_k$ of aball with $k$ handles $h^{n+1}_k$, but bounds a solid nothomeomorphic to $h^{n+1}_k$ (precisely, see below, p. 188).There remains the question of whether the above bound canbe improved if instead of $F_R$ some subset of $F_R$ isconsidered, consisting of surfaces of sufficiently simple topological structure of sufficiently simple imbedding in$E^{n+1}$. Some results in this direction were already presentedby us in the Second All-Union topological conference in Tbilisi in1959 \cite{LF}.We introduce notation: For $F\in F_R$ let $\kappa(F)$ be the radiusof a maximal ball interior to $F$. $M \subset F_R$, $\kappa(M) =\inf_{F\in M} \kappa(F)$.Let $\mathcal{S}$ be the subset of surfaces in $F_R$ homeomorphicto $S^n$; $\mathcal{H}_k$ those homeomorphic to a sphere with $k$handles, $S^n_k$;\medskip\hrule\smallskip\noindent p.~146.\medskip$\mathcal{H}^0_k$ those which bound a solid ball with $k$ handles,$h^{n+1}_k$; $Tr^0$ those which bound a solid toroidal ring, cf.\S \ref{sec:applications}, part 1.$$\kappa_1 = \sqrt{3/2} -1 \cong 0.2246.$$Then\begin{thm} \label{Theorem 1} If the first Betti number of $F$ mod 2 iszero, then $\kappa(F) \ge \kappa_1R$.\end{thm}In case $H_1(F,Z_2) \ne 0$ we turn to the universal coveringsolid $T$ of the boundary $F$; in connection with this a conditionis included on the homotopy type.\begin{thm}\label{Theorem 2} Let $F \in F_R$. If the homomorphism$h: \pi_1(F) \to \pi_1(T)$ induced by the inclusion of $F$ in$T$ is an isomorphism, and $\pi_2(T) = 0$, then $\kappa(F) \ge\kappa_1R$.\end{thm}For $n=2$ the condition of Theorem \ref{Theorem 2} can be weakened.\begin{thm}\label{Theorem 3} Let $n=2$, $F \in F_R$, and $h: \pi_1(F)\to \pi_1(T)$ be onto. Then $\kappa(F) \ge \kappa_1R$.\end{thm}From Theorems \ref{Theorem 1}, \ref{Theorem 2}, in combination with corresponding examples:\begin{thm}\label{Theorem 4} $\kappa(\mathcal{S}) \ge \kappa_1R$; $\kappa(\mathcal{H}^0_k)\ge \kappa_1R$; $\kappa(Tr^0) \ge \kappa_1R$.For $n=2$ these inequalities reduce to equality.\end{thm}Examples proving the second assertion of Theorem \ref{Theorem 4} will beconstructed in the second part of this work; Theorems \ref{Theorem 1} -- \ref{Theorem 3}and the first assertion of Theorem \ref{Theorem 4} are proved in this first part.Sharp bounds in Theorem \ref{Theorem 4} for $n>2$ are unknown. We note that$\kappa(\mathcal{H}_k) = \kappa_0R, \ k=1,2,\cdots$, cf. \cite{L3},Introduction. This shows that a surface homeomorphic to asphere with $k$ handles and bounding a solid ``sufficientlycorrectly'' in a topological sense contains a ball of radius$\kappa_1R$; but surfaces can be constructed for which thetopological type of the body bounded is ``incorrect'', whichcontain only balls of radius differing from $\kappa_0R$ by anarbitrarily small amount. The ``critical numbers'' $\kappa_0$and $\kappa_1$ have a simple geometrical meaning: $\kappa_0R$is the radius of the greatest circle in the plane included betweenthree tangent circular arcs of radius $R$; $\kappa_1R$ is theradius of the greatest ball in $E^3$ included between fourtangent spheres of radius $R$. In \cite{LF} the equation $\kappa(\mathcal{S}) = \kappa_1R$ was publishedfor the case $n=2$ of Theorem \ref{Theorem 3}; there also was indicated thepossibility of generalizing these results for any $n$.In this work we depend on geometric methods developed in\cite{L3} and in a series of results of the work \cite{L3} assumedto be known.\S \ref{sec:geom} is carried out with a purely geometric character. In it isestablished Lemma \ref{Lemma 2}, from which the proofs of our theoremsupon establishing that the multiplicity of the central set $Z$is greater than three (cf. \cite[p. 225 (3:5)]{L3}). As proved in\cite{L3}, the multiplicity of $Z$ must be greater than 2;consequently, it remains to obtain conditions on $F$ and $T$excluding multiplicity 3 and that it then follows that $\kappa(F)\ge \kappa_1R$. In \S \ref{sec:local} the local structure of $Z$ is studied underthe assumption that the multiplicity is 3. In \S \ref{sec:triang} it is provedthat $Z$ (in the case of multiplicity 3) has a topologicalstructure defined there and called a 3-complex.\medskip\hrule\smallskip\noindent p.~147.\medskipIn \S\S \ref{sec:cover} -- \ref{sec:graph} the topological properties of a 3-complex arestudied, abstracting from the fact that a 3-complex is acentral set of $T$; in these paragraphs only the basic topologicalproperties of the configuration $\{ F, T, Z \}$ are used whichare recounted at the beginning of \S \ref{sec:triang}. In the results it isclarified what the topological conditions are needed on $F,T$in order that a 3-complex $Z$ will fail to exist (Lemma \ref{Lemma 16}).The proof of our theorems are completed in \S \ref{sec:proofs} by combiningthe results of \S \ref{sec:triang} (cf. above) with Lemma \ref{Lemma 16}.\section{Geometrical lemmas}\label{sec:geom}\noindent 1. Let $g_1, \cdots, g_k$ be unit vectors in $E^{n+1}$,$\beta = $ the minimum angle between pairs of them, and$\alpha^{n+1}(k)$ the supremum of such $\beta$ (cf. \cite[p. 226]{L3}). We need\begin{lem}\label{Lemma 1} $\alpha^{n+1}(4) = 2 \csc^{-1}\sqrt{3/2}$.(Equality with $\beta$ occurs for the vectors which go from thecenter of a regular tetrahedron to its vertices.)\end{lem}[A proof due to Reshetnyak is given.]\noindent 2. Let $F^n \in F_R$ bound a body $T^{n+1}$; we designate by $Z$the central set [cut locus] of $F^n$ \cite[p. 224]{LF}. In thefollowing it is assumed everywhere that $F^n$ is a flattenedsurface, and consequently, $Z$ has multiplicity $>2$ (cf. \cite[pp. 206, 225]{L3}). Such assumptions do not limit the generality ofconsiderations, since for nonflattened $F^n$ the results of thiswork are evident, but for flattened ones the multiplicity of$Z$ is $>2$. (\cite[pp. 231-232]{L3}).\begin{lem}\label{Lemma 2} If the multiplicity of $Z$ is $>3$, then$F^n$ contains a sphere of radius $\kappa_1R$.\end{lem}[In the proof Lemma \ref{Lemma 1} is applied to 4 unit vectors going from apoint of multiplicity $\ge 4$ along lines normal to $F^n$.]\medskip\hrule\smallskip\noindent p.~148.\medskip\section{Local structure of the central set}\label{sec:local}[Standard properties of the cut locus of multiplicity 3 aredeveloped. Cf. Ozols paper on that subject. They are the propertiesabstracted as a normally imbedded 3-complex in \S \ref{sec:triang}.]\section{Triangulations and 3-complexes}\label{sec:triang}\medskip\hrule\smallskip\noindent p.~152.\medskip\noindent 1. Continuing we will need some properties of $Z$ shared with$\tilde Z$, the covering of $Z$ in the universal covering$\tilde T$ of $T$. To avoid repetition and provide convenientreference we formulate a {\em 3-complex $Z^n$ in} $T^{n+1}$ assatisfying:\begin{description}\item[1)] $Z^n$ is an $n$-dimensional locally finite polyhedron,triangulated by $\tau$.\item[2)] $Z^n$ contains a subcomplex $Z^{n-1}$, decomposedinto a finite or countable nonoverlapping union of$(n-1)$-manifolds $Z^{n-1}_i$.\item[3)] $Z^n\setminus Z^{n-1}$ is a finite or countableunion of $n$-dimensional manifolds.\item[4)] Each $(n-1)$-simplex of $Z^{n-1}$ is a face ofexactly 3 $n$-simplices of $Z^n$.\end{description}We say that the 3-complex $Z^n$ is {\em normally imbedded in$T^{n+1}$} if 5)--12) as follows hold.\begin{description}\item[5)] $T^{n+1}$ is an $(n+1)$-manifold with boundary $F^n$.($T^{n+1}$ is not generally compact, $F^n$ not generallyconnected.)\item[6)] $Z^n$ is a closed subset of $T^{n+1}\setminus F^n$.\item[7)] The triangulation $\tau$ is extended to one of$T^{n+1}$, $\tau^0$, for which $F^n$ is a subcomplex.\item[8)] $Z^n$ is a deformation retract of $T^{n+1}$ by$\varphi_t : T^{n+1} \to T^{n+1}$ with $\varphi_1 : T^{n+1} \toZ^n$ and $\varphi = \varphi_1|F^n$ is simplicial.\item[9)] $F^n$ is a deformation retract of $T^{n+1} \setminusZ^n$ by $\psi_t: T^{n+1} \setminus Z^n \to T^{n+1} \setminus Z^n$,deforming the identity $\psi_0$ to $\psi_1 = \psi : T^{n+1}\setminus Z^n \to F^n$.\item[10)] $\varphi$ is a 2-fold covering on $\varphi^{-1}(Z^n\setminus Z^{n-1})$.\item[11)] $\varphi$ is a 3-fold covering on $\varphi^{-1}(Z^{n-1})$.Moreover, each $Q \in Z^{n-1}$ has a neighborhood $W$ such that[$Z^n \cap W$ is a triad bundle over $Z^{n-1}$].\item[12)] The $Z^n$-star (closed) of each vertex $Q$ in $Z^n$belongs to a neighborhood $W(Q)$ evenly covered by $\varphi$(cf. 10)) if $Q \in Z^n \setminus Z^{n-1}$, or decomposed as in11) if $Q \in Z^{n-1}$. In each component of $Z^n \setminusZ^{n-1}$ there is at least one vertex $Q$ for which the closedstar doesn't meet $Z^{n-1}$.\end{description}\medskip\hrule\smallskip\noindent p.~153.\medskip\noindent {\em Remark.} The properties are not independent; forexample 4) follows from 11).\noindent 2.\begin{lem}\label{Lemma 4} If the central set $Z^n$ of a body$T^{n+1}$ of $(n+1)$-dimensional Euclidean space, bounded by asurface $F^n \in F^n_R$, has multiplicity 3, then $Z^n$ is a3-complex normally imbedded in $T^{n+1}$.\end{lem}For the triangulation use the methods of Whitney \cite[pp. 175-191]{W}.\medskip\hrule\smallskip\noindent p.~154.\medskipThe rest of the proof has been set up by the preceding material.In the continuation the triangulation of $T^{n+1}$ is assumedto extend triangulations of $Z^n, F^n$ so that $\varphi : F^n\to Z^n$ is simplicial.\noindent 3. We construct for the polyhedron $T^{n+1}$ of part 2 theuniversal covering $\kappa : \tilde T^{n+1} \to T^{n+1}$.$\tilde F^n = \kappa^{-1}(F^n)$ is the boundary of the manifold$\tilde T^{n+1}$, $\tilde Z^n = \kappa^{-1}(Z^n)$ is the universalcovering of $Z^n$, and the deformation retracts $\varphi_t,\psi_t$ can be lifted.\medskip\hrule\smallskip\noindent p.~155.\medskipThe triangulation can be lifted too, so\begin{lem}\label{Lemma 5} $\tilde Z^n$ is a 3-complex normallyimbedded in $\tilde T^{n+1}$.\end{lem}\section{Coverings in 3-complexes}\label{sec:cover}\noindent 1. Consider a normally imbedded 3-complex $Z^n \subset T^{n+1}$.Denote connected components by subscripts: $Z^{n-1}_j, Z^n_i,F^{n-1}_j, F^n_i$. The closures of the $n$-dimensional ones aresubcomplexes. $F^{n-1} = \varphi^{-1}(Z^{n-1})$, all havetriangulated closures.\begin{lem}\label{Lemma 6} \begin{description}\item[1)] If $P\in F^n \setminus F^{n-1}$ then$\varphi(P)$ is a double point of $Z^n$.\item[2)] If $P \in F^{n-1}$, then $\varphi(P)$ is a triple point.\item[3)] For each $F^{n-1}_j$, $\varphi(F^{n-1}_j)$ coincideswith some $Z^{n-1}_{k_j}$ and$\varphi : F^{n-1}_j \to Z^{n-1}_{k_j}$ is a covering.\item[4)] For each $Z^{n-1}_k$ there is at least on $F^{n-1}_j$such that $k = k_j$.\item[5)] If $F^{n-1}_j$ is oriented for all $j$ such that$k = k_j$, then so is $Z^{n-1}_k$.\end{description}\end{lem}[Of these only 5) seems to need explaining. Since $\varphi :\varphi^{-1}(Z^{n-1}_k) \to Z^{n-1}_k$ is a 3-fold covering,the restrictions to components of $\varphi^{-1}(Z^{n-1}_k)$must be coverings whose multiplicities add up to 3. One of themultiplicities must be odd (1 or 3), so that $Z^{n-1}_k$ isoriented.]\noindent 2. [In this part some combinatorics of simplices are developed.It is a clumsy but precise way of getting the essential propertiesof tubular neighborhoods of the $Z^{n-1}_j$. I believe a betteralternative is to use cells rather than simplices, and adapt thecells to the local product structure of the triad bundle.]\medskip\hrule\smallskip\noindent p.~157.\medskip\noindent 3. [ A similar development is given for tubular neighborhoods of$Z^n_i$ in $T^{n+1}$.]\medskip\hrule\smallskip\noindent p.~158.\medskip\noindent 4. [More combinatorics.]\medskip\hrule\smallskip\noindent p.~159.\medskip\noindent 5. [The idea of the holonomy of the triad bundle is pursuedusing the combinatorics of the previous parts. A component$Z^{n-1}_j$ is said to be a {\em manifold of the first class} ifthe holonomy is trivial. It is said to be of {\em of the secondclass} if the holonomy consists of a group of order 2, so thattwo arms of the triad can be transposed and neither is connectedto the third arm. If the holonomy group is transitive on the threearms, it is said to be {\em of the third class}.\medskip\hrule\smallskip\noindent p.~160. \medskipThe finerclassification of the third class into those with holonomy thealternating subgroup of the three arms and those with holonomyall permutations of the three arms is not discussed. Probably thelatter is ruled out later by orientability considerations, alongwith those of the second class.]\section{Basic topological lemmas}\label{sec:basic}\noindent 1. We consider homology groups $H_q(M,G)$ using $G = J$, theintegers, and $G=J_2$, the integers mod 2. For infinite butlocally finite complexes there are further homology theories:$H^{fin}_q(M,G)$, the homology of finite chains, and$H^{inf}_q(M,G)$, the homology of infinite chains. The basicreference is \cite[\S 9]{E}. The symbol $\sim$ is used todenote ``homologous''.\begin{lem}\label{Lemma 11} If $H^{inf}_{n-1}(T^{n+1},J) = 0$ and all$Z^{n-1}_j$ are orientable, then manifolds of the third classdon't exist.\end{lem}\begin{proof} Since $Z^n$ is a deformation retract of $T^{n+1}$,we also have that $H^{inf}_{n-1}(Z^n,J)=0$. Since $Z^{n-1}_j$ isorientable, it is a cycle for a chosen orientation. But then itmust be a boundary in $Z^n$, $Z^{n-1}_j = \partial c^n$ for some$n$-chain of $Z^n$.If $Z^{n-1}_j$ is of the third class, then any [$n$-cell] adjacentto $Z^{n-1}$ [has a coefficient in $c^n$ which must propogate toadjacent cells in a tubular neighborhood of $Z^{n-1}_j$,continuing to all of the cells adjacent to $Z^{n-1}_j$. If the$n$-manifold formed by these cells is orientable, then theboundary of $c^n$ must have every $(n-1)$-cell of $Z^{n-1}_j$with coefficient which is a multiple of 3. If the $n$-manifoldis nonorientable, then the holonomy contains a transpositionand the boundary of $c^n$ could not have all $(n-1)$-cells ofthe interior of the $n$-manifold cancel, so the boundary couldnot be the fundamental class of $Z^{n-1}_j$.]\end{proof}\medskip\hrule\smallskip\noindent p.~161.\medskip\noindent 2.\begin{lem}\label{Lemma 12} If $T^{n+1}$ and $Z^{n-1}$ are orientable,then there are no manifolds of the second class.\end{lem}[If the holonomy has a transposition, then the normal bundle of$Z^{n-1}$ is nonorientable, so just one of $T^{n+1}$ and $Z^{n-1}$is orientable along the loop giving that transposition.]\noindent 3. We turn to the study of manifolds of the first class. If$Z^{n-1}_j$ is of the first class, then a [tubular neighborhoodof $Z^{n-1}$ with $Z^{n-1}$ removed] has three connectedcomponents, the {\em 3 sheets adjacent to $Z^{n-1}_j$}.[Another Lemma, omitted, formulates this in terms of the combinatorics ofsimplices.]\medskip\hrule\smallskip\noindent p.~163.\medskip\noindent 4. Designate the 3 sheets in a tubular neighborhood $U$ of$Z^{n-1}_j$ by $M_{j\alpha}, \alpha = 1,2,3$. The closures ofthese $U$ are assumed to be disjoint.\begin{lem}\label{Lemma 14} Let $Z^{n-1}_j$ be of the first class.Then\begin{description}\item[1)] Two distinct $M_{j\alpha}$'s have no interior pointsof $Z^n$ in common. The only component of $Z^{n-1}$ havingpoints in the closure of $M_{j\alpha}$ is $Z^{n-1}_j$.\item[2)] Each manifold $Z^n_i$ has at least one point notbelonging to any ${\bar M}_{j\alpha}$.\item[3)] Each ${\bar M }_{j\alpha}$ belongs to a unique${\bar Z}^n_i$ and does not have interior points in commonwith any other ${\bar Z}^n_k$.\item[4)] For the $n$-chain mod 2 carried by $M_{j\alpha}$,also designated by $M_{j\alpha}$, the boundary is\begin{equation}\label{eq:lem14}\partial M_{j\alpha} = Z^{n-1}_j + z^{n-1}_{j\alpha}\end{equation}where $Z^{n-1}_j$ is the fundamental $(n-1)$-cycle mod 2 of$Z^{n-1}_j$ and $z^{n-1}_{j\alpha}$ is a cycle mod 2, not 0,and having no common points with $Z^{n-1}$.\end{description}\end{lem}[Again this is given and proved in terms of the simplicialtriangulation.In terms of the structure of bundles over the $Z^{n-1}$ withtriad bundle, the assumption that $Z^{n-1}_j$ is of the firstclass tells us that the bundle is trivial, so that${\bar M}^{n-1}_{j\alpha} = Z^{n-1}_j \times [0,1]$, and inthese terms 4) is geometrically transparent:$$\partial M^{n-1}_{j\alpha} = Z^{n-1}_j \times \{0\} +Z^{n-1}_{j\alpha} \times \{1\}.]$$\medskip\hrule\smallskip\noindent p.~165.\medskip\noindent 5.\begin{lem}\label{Lemma 15} Let $F^n$ be orientable and$H^{fin}_1(F^n,J_2) = 0$; then all $Z^{n-1}_j$ are orientable.\end{lem}[The proof given invokes Poincar\'e duality (\cite[\S 33]{E})in the form $H^{fin}_1(F^n,J_2) \approx H^{inf}_{n-1}(F^n,J_2)$,and goes on to argue that $(n-1)$-submanifolds $F^{n-1}_j$ of$F^n$ are orientable. Then since $\varphi ; F^{n-1}_j\to Z^{n-1}_j$ is a 3-fold cover, $Z^{n-1}_j$ must be orientabletoo.We can avoid the use of Poincar\'e duality by a more directargument to show that $F^{n-1}_j$. Suppose we have a loop$\gamma$ in $F^{n-1}_j$. What $H^{fin}_1(F^n,J_2) = 0$ meansis that $\gamma = \partial c^2$, where $c^2$ is a finite 2-chainmod 2. Hence $c^2$ is carried by a compact immersed 2-manifold$S$ with boundary. We can put $S$ in general position relativeto $F^{n-1}_j$, which means that the intersection is a graphincluding $\gamma$ in such a way that vertices on $\gamma$are all triple points and there are no other branch points. Usingthis graph we decompose $\gamma$ into a sum of simple cyclesalong which $S$ provides a normal field to $F^{n-1}_j$. Since$F^n$ is orientable, these simple cycles preserve orientationon $F^{n-1}_j$, and hence so does $\gamma$.]\section{Representing graph}\label{sec:graph}\noindent 1. The complex $Z^n$ is built from subcomplexes $Z^n_i$,attached to one another by subcomplexes $Z^{n-1}_j$; for a moredetailed study of this situation we construct the {\em representinggraph} $\Gamma$ of the 3-complex $Z^n$. This has two kinds of vertices:$e_i$ -- principal vertices, one for each $Z^n_i$;$\epsilon_j$ -- auxiliary vertices, one for each $Z^{n-1}_j$;\noindent and edges $k_{j\alpha}$ corresponding to the sheets$M_{j\alpha}$ and joining a principal vertex to an auxiliaryvertex if and only if the sheet of the auxiliary vertex$\epsilon_j$ is contained in the $Z^n_i$ corresponding to theprincipal vertex $e_i$.There are just 3 edges ending in each auxiliary vertex; evenif some of the 3 sheets coincide we still take 3 edges [but seethe next paragraph].Somewhat retreating from the customary definition of a graph,we call the set of all vertices and edges of $\Gamma$ the{\em representing graph} of the 3-complex $Z^n$. We note thatmanifolds $Z^{n-1}_j$ of the second and third class do notplay a r\^ole in the preceding definition, which will be usedonly under conditions guaranteeing the nonexistence of suchmanifolds.\noindent 2. We say that a subgraph $\Gamma' \subset \Gamma$ is a{\em proper tree} if $\Gamma'$ has no cycles and each auxiliaryvertex of $\Gamma'$ is incident with exactly two edges.[This definition seems incomplete: I think they intend toinclude connectedness and/or maximality with respect tothe specified properties.]\medskip\hrule\smallskip\noindent p.~166.\medskip\begin{lem}\label{Lemma 16} $\Gamma$ has either a cycle or aproper tree.\end{lem}\begin{proof} Build $\Gamma'$ recursively as an increasingunion of connected subgraphs. Start with $\Gamma_1$consisting of a single principal vertex, all of the edges fromit, and the auxiliary vertices at the other end of those edges.Stop whenever a cycle is obtained. Otherwise get$\Gamma_{\mu +1}$ from $\Gamma_\mu$ by choosing a secondedge for each auxiliary vertex of $\Gamma_\mu$ which hasno second edge, add in the other ends of those new secondedges, and add in all the edges (and their ends) incident tothe new principal vertices.\medskip\hrule\smallskip\noindent p.~167.\medskipIn this process, if we are forced to take into $\Gamma_{\mu+1}$the third edge of some auxiliary vertex already in $\Gamma_\mu$,then within $\Gamma_{\mu+1}$ there are two distinct pathsfrom the starting vertex to the auxiliary vertex in question:one in $\gamma_\mu$ and one in $\Gamma_{\mu+1}$ usingthe third edge. Hence $\Gamma_{\mu+1}$ must contain a cycle.Taking $\Gamma' = \bigcup_\mu \Gamma_\mu$, either$\Gamma'$ has a cycle or it is a proper tree such that\begin{description}\item[1)] $\Gamma'$ is connected and\item[2)] whenever a principal vertex belongs to $\Gamma'$,then so do all the edges incident to it.\end{description}\end{proof}\medskip\hrule\smallskip\noindent p.~168.\medskip\noindent 3. Corresponding to each cycle $\Gamma_0 \subset \Gamma$we construct a 1-cycle with compact support in the polyhedron$Z^n$. Let $\Gamma_0$ consist of edges $k_{j_s\alpha_s},s=1,\ldots, t$; $t$ is even (equal to twice the number ofprincipal vertices incident to the edges of $\Gamma_0$).Let the numbering of the edges of $\Gamma_0$ be carriedout so that the ends of $k_{j_s\alpha_s}$ are the principalvertex $e_{i_s}$ and the auxiliary vertex $\epsilon_{j_s}$,$\epsilon_{j_s} = \epsilon_{j_{s+1}}$ for $1 \le s < t, s$ odd,$e_{i_s} = e_{i_{s+1}}$ for $1<s<t, s$ even, $e_{i_t} = e_{i_1}$.For convenience in writing out we will understand by$k_{j_{t+1},\alpha_{t+1}}, \epsilon_{j_{t+1}}$, respectively,$k_{j_1,\alpha_1}, \epsilon_{j_1}$.\begin{lem}\label{Lemma 17} For each vertex of $\Gamma_0$ choosea point in the interior of the corresponding submanifold $Z^n_i$or $Z^{n-1}_j$. For each edge of $\Gamma_0$ with ends $e_i$and $\epsilon_j$ choose a path in $Z^n_i$ from $e_i$ to$\epsilon_j$ which contains points of only the correspondingsheet of $Z^{n-1}_j$ besides points in $Z^n_i$ -- no other sheetsof $Z^{n-1}_j$ nor any other $Z^{n-1}_k, j \ne k$. Then thesepaths will form a loop in $Z^n$, and if the loop in $\Gamma_0$is simple, the loop in $Z^n$ can be chosen to be simple as well.Moreover, at points of $Z^{n-1}$\medskip\hrule\smallskip\noindent p.~169.\medskip\noindent on this loop in $Z^n$ the loop passes from one sheet of$Z^{n-1}_j$ to another, and (if simple) can never hit $Z^{n-1}_j$again because $\epsilon_j$ can only occur once in the loop of$\Gamma_0$.\end{lem}This means that each $Z^{n-1}_j$ crossed by one of these loopsdoes not separate $Z^{n-1}_j$. [What if $n=2$ and $Z^{n-1}_j$ isnot closed?]\noindent 4. For a proper tree $\Gamma' \subset \Gamma$ we constructan $n$-dimensional submanifold $M'\subset Z^n$. $M'$ consistsof the union of ${\bar Z}^n_i$ for which $e_i$ is a vertex of$\Gamma'$. By the requirement that $\Gamma'$ has all of theedges attached to such an $e_i$, all of the boundary of $Z^n_i$is contained in $M'$. By the requirement that each $\epsilon_j$in $\Gamma'$ is incident to exactly two edges in $\Gamma'$,$M'$ is a manifold in a neighborhood of each point of $Z^{n-1}_j$,since exactly two of the 3 sheets along $Z^{n-1}_j$ are containedin $M'$.\begin{lem}\label{Lemma 18} Clearly $M'$ forms an $n$-cycle mod 2 in$T^{n+1}$. If $F^n$ is connected, then $M'$ does not separate$T^{n+1}$. Indeed, starting at a point $A$ of $M'$ in $Z^n_i$ wecan run out on either side to the points $\varphi^{-1}(A) =\{ A', A''\} \subset F^n$. Then $A', A''$ can be connected by apath in $F^n$, closing a loop which crosses $M'$ simply.\end{lem}\section{Proofs of theorems 1,2,3}\label{sec:proofs}\noindent 1. In this paragraph theorems 1,2,3 are proved, giving sufficienttopological conditions for the validity of the bound $\kappa(F) \ge\kappa_1R$ in the class $F_R$. First we prove two lemmas.\begin{lem}\label{Lemma 19} For a 3-complex $Z^n$ normally imbeddedin $T^{n+1}$ the following conditions cannot hold simultaneously:\begin{description}\item[1)] the boundary $F^n$ of $T^{n+1}$ is connected;\item[2)] $F^n$ is orientable;\item[3)] $T^{n+1}$ is orientable;\item[4)] $H^{fin}_1(F^n,J_2) = 0$;\item[5)] $H^{fin}_1(T^{n+1},J_2) = 0$; [i.e., $H^{fin}_1(Z^n,J_2)= 0$]\item[6)] $H^{inf}_{n-1}(T^{n+1}, J) = 0$. [i.e.,$H^{inf}_{n-1}(Z^n,J) =0$]\end{description}\end{lem}\begin{proof} We suppose 1) -- 6) hold.a) From conditions 2) and 4) and Lemma 15 it follows that all$Z^{n-1}_j$ are orientable.Due to condition 6) and Lemma \ref{Lemma 11} there do not exist manifolds$Z^{n-1}_j$ of the third class. From condition 3) and Lemma \ref{Lemma 12}it follows that also there do not exist manifolds $Z^{n-1}_j$ ofthe second class.b) We consider the first possibility specified in Lemma 16: letthe representing graph $\Gamma$ of the 3-complex $Z^n$ containa cycle $\Gamma_0$. According to Lemma 17, $\Gamma_0$corresponds to a 1-cycle $\zeta$ of the complex $Z^n$. Fromcondition 5) it follows that there is a finite 2-chain $c^2$ in$Z^n$ such that $\partial c^2 = \zeta$ mod 2. (21) [Some of the numbering of equations in the original is retained.]\medskip\hrule\smallskip\noindent p.~171.\medskip[This is my proof. We may assume $\zeta$ is a simple loop. We can realize $c^2$ as a union of immersedcompact surfaces, one of which has boundary $\zeta$, the otherswithout boundary. By taking them in general position we canassume that the intersection with any $Z^{n-1}_j$ is a union ofregular curves. Since $Z^{n-1}_j$ is a closed $(n-1)$ manifold(not necessarily compact), the intersections with these surfacesare circles except for the one with boundary $\zeta$. Because$\zeta$ crosses $Z^{n-1}_j$ just once, there is only one endpointfor the intersection of that part of $c^2$ with $Z^{n-1}_j$ whichis impossible.][The proof given.] We take an arbitrary manifold $Z^n_i$intersecting $\zeta$; designate by $c^2_j$ the 2-chain mod 2consisting of all simplices of ${\bar Z}^n_i$ belonging to $c^2$.[From part 3, \S \ref{sec:graph}, we had $\zeta_i$, the part of $\zeta$ in${\bar Z}^n_i$.] Then from (21) we see that \begin{equation}\partial c^2_i = \zeta_i + c_i \label{eq:22}\end{equation}where $c_i \subset Z^{n-1}$. In defining ``sheets''$M^{n-1}_{j\alpha}$ we had a cycle ``parallel'' to $Z^{n-1}_j$forming the boundary of that sheet$$\partial M^{n-1}_{j\alpha} = Z^{n-1}_j + z^{n-1}_{j\alpha}.$$Let $Z^{n-1}_j$ be one of the components of $Z^{n-1}$ containingan end of $\zeta_i$ so that the sheet $M^{n-1}_{j\alpha} \subset{\bar Z}^n_i$. Then $\zeta$ has intersection number 1 with$z^{n-1}_{j\alpha}$, just as it does with $Z^{n-1}_j$. We usenotation $\times$ for intersection numbers: $z^{n-1}_{j\alpha}\times \zeta = 1$. Since $z^{n-1}_{j\alpha} \subset Zn_i \subsetZ^n \setminus Z^{n-1}$, from (\ref{eq:22}) we obtain\begin{equation}\partial c^2_i \times z^{n-1}_{j\alpha} = 1 \text{ in } Z^n_i.\label{eq:23}\end{equation}Let $C$ be the union of all the closed stars of the complex${\bar Z}^n_i$ intersecting the support of $c^2_i$. Since $c^2_i$is finite and $Z^n$ is a locally finite polyhedron, so also $C$consists of a finite number of simplices.It is clear that\begin{equation}\partial C \cap c^2_i \cap Z^n_i = 0. \label{eq:24}\end{equation}[$C$ is a tubular neighborhood of $c^2_i$, so its boundary onlyintersects $c^2_i$ at the ends of the tube, which lie in $Z^{n-1}$,excluded from the open manifold $Z^n_i$.]Let $c^{n-1}$ consist of all the simplices of $Z^{n-1}_{j\alpha}$belonging to $C$; since $z^{n-1}_{j\alpha}$ is a cycle (generallyspeaking, infinite), $\partial c^{n-1}$ is contained in the supportof $\partial C$, and from (\ref{eq:24}) we arrive at$$\partial c^2_i \times z^{n-1}_{j\alpha} = \partial c^2_i \timesc^{n-1} = c^2_i \times \partial c^{n-1} = 0,$$which contradicts (\ref{eq:23}).c) We consider the second possibility specified in Lemma \ref{Lemma 16}: let$\Gamma$ contain a proper tree $\Gamma'$. The result of parta) allows the use of Lemma \ref{Lemma 18}. According to Lemma \ref{Lemma 18},$\Gamma'$ corresponds to an $n$-dimensional (generallyspeaking infinite) cycle $\zeta^n$ mod 2 of the polyhedron$Z^n$. [$\zeta^n$ is an $n$-manifold. From a point on it, $A_0$,we can move on paths on either side (locally) in $T^{n+1}$ outto points $B_1,B_2 \in F^n$. connecting $B_1,B_2$ by an arc in$F^n$ we get a loop $\delta$ in $T^{n+1}$ having a simpleintersection with $\zeta^n$.] $\delta$ can be representedsimplicially and we have $\delta \times \zeta^n = 1$ (27).\medskip\hrule\smallskip\noindent p.~172.\medskipBy condition 5), $\delta = \partial b^2$ mod 2 for some finitemod 2 2-chain $b^2$. By the same argument as in b) we reach acontradiction. [$b^2$ is essentially a compact immersed surfacewith boundary $\delta$. It can be taken in general positionrelative to $Z^n$, so the intersection is a regular curve. But thatcurve only has one end by (27).]\end{proof}\noindent 2.\begin{lem}\label{Lemma 20} Let $T^{n+1}$ be a manifold withboundary $F^n$, lying in Euclidean space $E^{n+1}$, and with$F^n$ connected. If the homomorphism $h: \pi_1(F^n) \to\pi_1(T^{n+1})$, induced by the inclusion of $F^n$ in $T^{n+1}$,is an isomorphism [1-1 and onto], then in the universal covering$\tilde T^{n+1}$ of the polyhedron $T^{n+1}$ the polyhedron$\tilde F^n$ covering $F^n$ is connected and simply connected.If in addition $\pi_2(T^{n+1}) = 0$, then$H^{fin}_2(\tilde T^{n+1}, J) = 0$.\end{lem}\begin{proof} Let $\kappa : \tilde T^{n+1} \to T^{n+1}$ be thecovering map; then $\kappa^{-1}(F^n) = \tilde F^n$ is, evidently,the union of a finite or countable number of (connected)manifolds. We show that $\tilde F^n$ is connected. [Just lift apath between the images of two points. This reduces it to thecase of connecting two points $\tilde a_1, \tilde A_2 \in\kappa^{-1}(A), A\in F^n$. Then there is a loop in $T^{n+1}$ at $A$such that its lift to $\tilde A_1$ is a path to $\tilde A_2$Since $\pi_1(F^n) \to \pi_1(T^{n+1})$ is {\em onto}, the loop in$T^{n+1}$ is homotopic to a loop in $F^n$ which lifts to a pathin $\tilde F^n$ connecting $\tilde A_1, \tilde A_2$.]Now let $\tilde \lambda$ be a closed path in $\tilde F^n$ basedat $\tilde A$, $\kappa(\tilde \lambda) = \lambda, \kappa(\tilde A) =A$; then $\lambda$ is homotopic to the trivial loop in $T^{n+1}$.Since $h$ is 1-1, $\lambda$ is nonhomotopic to the trivial loop in$F^n$; but then $\tilde \lambda$ is homotopic to the trivial loopin $\tilde F^n$.Finally, $\pi_2(\tilde T^{n+1}) = \pi_2(T^{n+1}) = 0$,$\pi_1(\tilde T^{n+1}) = 0$, and by Hurewicz's theorem (cf.,for example \cite[p. 57]{H}), $H^{fin}_2(\tilde T^{n+1}, J) = 0$.\end{proof}\noindent 3.\begin{thm} [= Theorem \ref{Theorem 1}] Let $F^n$ be a surface of class$F_R$ in Euclidean space $E^{n+1}$ and suppose $H_1(F^n, J_2)= 0$. Then $\kappa(F) \ge \kappa_1R$.\end{thm}\begin{proof} According to Poincar\'e duality $H_{n-1}(F^n,J_2)= H_1(F^n,J_2) = 0$ (\cite[p. 484 $3.33_2$]{A1}). Applying Alexanderduality to the polyhedron $F^n \subset E^{n+1}$ (\cite[p. 490, 4:13]{A1}), we are led to $$H_1(E^{n+1} \setminus F^n, J_2) = H_{n-1}(F^n, J_2) = 0.$$But by the Jordan-Brouwer theorem (\cite[p. 519, 3:44]{A1}),$T^{n+1}$ is a connected component of $E^{n+1} \setminusF^n$, from whence $H_1(T^{n+1}, J_2) = 0$.[There is a more direct argument that $H_1(F^n, J_2) = 0\Rightarrow H_1(T^{n+1}, J_2) = 0$. Suppose we have a 1-cyclemod 2 in $T^{n+1}$; that is, a formal sum of loops $z^1$. We canfill a loop in $E^{n+1}$ with a surface $S$ which can be assumedto have general position relative to $F^n$. The intersection ofthat surface with $F^n$ then consists of several loops whichform the boundary of the inside $S\cap T^{n+1}$ except for thegiven loop. Each of those loops in $S\cap F^n$ is the boundary ofa surface in $F^n$ since $H_1(F^n, J_2) = 0$, and if we replacethe outside $S \setminus T^{n+1}$ by these surfaces in $F^n$we get a surface in $T^{n+1}$ whose boundary is the originalloop.]Thus, conditions 4), 5) of Lemma \ref{Lemma 19} are satisfied. Moreover,$H_1(F^n, J_2) = 0 \Rightarrow H_1(F^n, J)$ has no $J$-summand.(\cite[p.358, theorem 4:41]{A1}.) By Alexander duality then$H_{n-1}(T^{n+1}, J)$ has no $J$-summand (\cite[p. 490, 4:1]{A1});the torsion group $\Theta_{n-1}(T^{n+1})$ is always trivial(cf. the corollary of 4:1 immediately after the formulation of 4:1,\cite[p. 490]{A1}). Hence $H_{n-1}(T^{n+1}, J) =0$, and condition 6)of Lemma \ref{Lemma 19} holds.Conditions 1), 3) hold by an obvious means. Finally, condition 2)follows from the theorem of Jordan-Brouwer.By Lemma \ref{Lemma 19} $T^{n+1}$ cannot contain a normally imbedded3-complex, so that either the central set of $F^n$ has pointsof multiplicity $>3$ and hence $\kappa(F^n) \ge \kappa_1R$, or thecutlocus has focal points and $\kappa(F^n) \ge R$. This completesthe proof of Theorem \ref{Theorem 1}.\end{proof}\begin{thm} [= Theorem \ref{Theorem 2}] Let $F \in F_R$. If the homomorphism$h: \pi_1(F) \to \pi_1(T)$ induced by the inclusion of $F$ in$T$ is an isomorphism, and $\pi_2(T) = 0$, then $\kappa(F) \ge\kappa_1R$.\end{thm}{\sloppy\begin{proof} Let the multiplicity of $Z^n$ equal 3. Accordingto Lemma \ref{Lemma 5}, in the universal covering $\tilde T^{n+1}$ of thepolyhedron $T^{n+1}$ there is contained a cutlocus $\tilde Z^n$,normally imbedded in $\tilde T^{n+1}$as a 3-complex.Therefore, as in the proof of Theorem \ref{Theorem 1}, it suffices to verify for$\tilde T^{n+1}$that properties 1) -- 6) of Lemma \ref{Lemma 19} hold.From Lemma \ref{Lemma 20} it follows that $\tilde F^n$ is connected andsimply-connected; therefore conditions 1), 2), 4) hold. Conditions3) and 5) hold in view of the simple-connectedness of$\tilde T^{n+1}$. It remains to verify condition 6). According toLemma \ref{Lemma 20}, $H^{fin}_2(\tilde T^{n+1}, J) =0$ We apply Poincar\'eduality for infinite manifolds to $\tilde T^{n+1}$ (cf, e.g., \cite[\S\S 9, 33]{E}), accounting for condition 5) of Lemma \ref{Lemma 19}; we obtain$H^{inf}_{n-1}(\tilde T^{n+1}, J) = 0$, that is, condition 6) alsoholds, which concludes the proof of the theorem.\end{proof}}In the case $n=2$ (of a surface $F^2$ in 3-dimensional space)the condition of Theorem \ref{Theorem 2} can be significantly weakened.\begin{thm} [= Theorem \ref{Theorem 3}] Let $n=2$, $F \in F_R$, and$h: \pi_1(F) \to \pi_1(T)$ be onto. Then $\kappa(F) \ge \kappa_1R$.\end{thm}\medskip\hrule\smallskip\noindent p.~174.\medskip\begin{proof} We verify the conditions for applying Lemma \ref{Lemma 19}to $\tilde T^3$. For $n=2$ condition 6) of Lemma \ref{Lemma 19} is found tobe unnecessary; concerning this, this condition was needed toprove the nonexistence of manifolds $\tilde Z^{n-1}_j$ of thethird class (Lemma \ref{Lemma 11}). But a manifold $\tilde Z^1_j$ of thethird class would need to be a simply closed curve, sinceotherwise [the holonomy would be trivial]. Consequently, it maybe assumed that $\tilde Z^1_j$ is a {\em finite} cycle of$\tilde Z^2$. The orientability of $\tilde Z^1_j$ is evident, andthe exclusion of manifolds of the third follows from thetriviality of $H^{fin}_1(\tilde T^3, J)$ for a simply-connectedpolyhedron $\tilde T^3$.Moreover, conditions 2) and 4) are also found to be unnecessary.Concerning this, in the proof of Lemma \ref{Lemma 19} conditions 2) and 4)were used only in point a), in order to claim the orientability of$\tilde Z^{n-1}_j$, which for $n=2$ holds automatically.Conditions 3, 5) hold for simply-connected polyhedron $\tilde T$,and it is only needed to verify condition 1). But for the proof ofconnectedness of $\tilde F^n$ in Lemma \ref{Lemma 20} only the {\em ontoness}of the homomorphism $h$ was used, which is assumed forTheorem \ref{Theorem 3}.\end{proof}\section{Applications to some simple types of surfaces}\label{sec:applications}\noindent 1. We consider now several particular cases, presenting interestfrom a geometrical point of view. We give a definition of a{\em solid homeomorphic to a ball with k handles}.Let $K^{n+1}$ be a regular closed ball in $E^{n+1}$ and $f_j,j=1,\ldots, k$ be homeomorphisms from $K^n \times [0,1]$into $E^{n+1}$ such that the sets $Q_j = f_j(K^n\times (0,1))\subset E^{n+1} \setminus K^{n+1}$, $\bar Q_j$ are pairwisenonintersecting, and $[f_j(K^n \times 0) \cap f_j(K^n \times 1)]\subset K^{n+1}, j=1,\ldots, k$. The polyhedron $h^{n+1}_k =K^{n+1} \cap \bigcap^k_{j=1} Q_j$ is called an$(n+1)$-dimensional ball with $k$ handles, and the boundary of$h^{n+1}_k$ in $E^{n+1}$ is called an $n$-dimensional spherewith $k$ handles and is designated by $S^n_k$.A {\em regular (n+1)-dimensional toroidal ring $Tr^{n+1}$} isthe direct product of the disk $K^2$ by $E^{n-1}$ [sic. Should this be $S^{n-1}$? or $(S^1)^{n-1}$?]Finally, we designate the $n$-dimensional sphere by $S^n$.We now introduce the following classes of surfaces (cf. \S \ref{sec:introduction}): $\mathcal{S}$ consists of all surfaces of class $F_R$homeomorphic to $S^n$; $\mathcal{H}_k$ consists of all surfaces ofclass $F_R$ homeomorphic to $S^n_k$; $\mathcal{H}^0_k$ consistsof all surfaces of class $F_R$ bounding a solid homeomorphic to $h^{n+1}_k$; $Tr^0$ consists of all surfaces of class $F_R$bounding a solid homeomorphic to $Tr^{n+1}$.We recall that $\kappa(M) = \inf_{F \in M} \kappa(F), M\subset F_R$.\noindent 2.\begin{thm} [= Theorem \ref{Theorem 4}] $\kappa(\mathcal{S}) \ge \kappa_1R$;$\kappa(\mathcal{H}^0_k) \ge \kappa_1R$; $\kappa(Tr^0) \ge \kappa_1R$.For $n=2$ these inequalities reduce to equality.\end{thm}\begin{proof} In this part of the work we limit ourselvesto the proofs of the inequalities $\kappa(\mathcal{S}) \ge\kappa_1R$, $\kappa(\mathcal{H}^0_k) \ge \kappa_1R$,$\kappa(Tr^0) \ge \kappa_1R$; the sharp bound for classes$\mathcal{S}$, $\mathcal{H}^0_k$ for $n=2$ and any $k = 1, 2, \ldots$will be established in the second part of the work by theconstruction of corresponding examples (we note that for$n = 2$ we have $Tr^0 = \mathcal{H}^0_1$).\medskip\hrule\smallskip\noindent p.~175\medskip\begin{description}\item[a)] If $F^n \in \mathcal{S}$, then the assertion of the theoremfollows from Theorem \ref{Theorem 1}.\item[b)] If $F^n \in \mathcal{H}^0_k \, (k>0)$, then, as is easilyseen, $F^n$ contains a subset $T^1$, homeomorphic to theunion of $k$ circles with one common point, such that thereexists a deformation $$\omega_t: T^{n+1} \times [0,1] \to T^{n+1},$$$\omega_t(P) = P \, (P \in T^1, 0 \le t \le 1)$, of the identitymap $\omega_0$ into $\omega_1$, $\omega_1(T^{n+1})\subset T^1$. For $n = 2$ thus it follows that $h$ is ontoand Theorem \ref{Theorem 3} can be applied.Hence it follows that the homomorphism $h : \pi_1(F^n) \to\pi_1(T^{n+1})$, induced by $F^n \subset T^{n+1}$, is anisomorphism; $\pi_2(T^{n+1}) = \pi_2(T^1)$. Consideringthe universal covering polyhedron $\tilde T^1$, it is easyto convince oneself that $\pi_2(\tilde T^1) = 0$, whence$\pi_2(T^1) = 0$; hence Theorem 2 can be applied to a surface$F^n \in \mathcal{H}^0_k$, which leads to the required bound.[$h$ is not an isomorphism for $n = 2$, only onto, but thatcase has been covered.]\item[c)] Let $F^n \in Tr^0$. We construct the universalcovering polyhedron $\tilde T^{n+1}$ for the solid $T^{n+1}$,bonded by $F^n$ in $E^{n+1}$. Evidently, $\tilde T^{n+1}$ ishomeomorphic to $K^2 \times E^{n-1}$, $\tilde F^n$ ishomeomorphic to $S^1 \times E^{n-1}$ [the text was written$E^{n+1}$]. We verify the conditions for the applicabilityof Lemma \ref{Lemma 19} to $\tilde T^{n+1}$.\end{description}Evidently, all conditions besides 4) hold. But 4) was usedonly in point a) of the proof of Lemma \ref{Lemma 19} for establishingthe orientability of manifolds $\tilde Z^{n-1}_j$. By Lemma6, 5), for this it suffices to prove the orientability of themanifolds $\tilde F^{n-1}_j \subset \tilde F^n$.By a small isotopic deformation $\tilde F^{n-1}_j$ can bemoved to general position relative to the cycle $z^{n-1} =P \times E^{n-1}$, $P\in S^1$ (the construction of such adeformation is simplified thanks to the special from of$z^{n-1}$). We also desigante the cycle obtained as a resultof the deformation by $\tilde F^{n-1}_j$ and we note thatin the deformation the characteristic of orientability of$\tilde F^{n-1}_j$ is not changed. We construct, furthermore,a simplicial subdivision of $\tilde F^n$, subcomplexes ofwhich are $\tilde F^{n-1}_j$ and $z^{n-1}$. since $z^{n-1}$is the unique basis of homology cycles mod 2 of thepolyhedron $\tilde F^n$, there exists a chain $c^n$ (infinite)mod 2 constructed in the above subdivision, such that\begin{equation}\partial c^n = \tilde F^{n-1}_j + z^{n-1}. \label{eq:29}\end{equation}We take an integral chain $z^{n-1}_*$, which in mod 2 reducesto $z^{n-1}$. For each component of string connectedness$c^n_\alpha$ of the chain $c^n$ we choose an orientation ofthe simplices of $C^n_\alpha$ such that for the integral chain $c^n_{\alpha *}$ obtained $$\partial c^n_\alpha = \tilde F^{n-1}_{j\alpha *} +c^{n-1}_{\alpha *}, $$where $\tilde F^{n-1}_{j\alpha *}$ consists of orientedsimplices of $\tilde F^{n-1}_j$, and $z^{n-1}_{\alpha *}$consists of oriented simplices of $z^{n-1}$. It can be achievedin this that the orientation of the simplices of$z^{n-1}_{\alpha *}$ should be in accord with the orientationfixed above $z^{n-1}$ of the cycle $z^{n-1}$; concerning this,$c^n_\alpha$ lies in one of the two domains into which$z^{n-1}$ separates $\tilde F^n$, and therefore for all orientedsimplices $\zeta^n$ of the chain $c^n_{\alpha *}$ and thesimplices $\zeta^{n-1}$ of the chain $z^{n-1}_*$ adjacentwith the coefficients of incidence $[\zeta^n : \zeta^{n-1}]$are 1 throughout.Since for each simplex of $\tilde F^{n-1}_j$ and $z^{n-1}$the incidence equals 1 with simplices of $c^n$, the chains$\tilde F^{n-1}_{j\alpha *}$, $z^{n-1}_{\alpha *}$,$\tilde F^{n-1}_{\beta *}$, $z^{n-1}_{\beta *}$ for$\alpha \ne \beta$ do not have simplices in common. We put$c^n_* = \sum_\alpha c^n_{\alpha *}$; then\begin{equation}\partial c^n_* = \sum_\alpha \tilde F^{n-1}_{j\alpha *} +\sum_\alpha z^{n-1}_{\alpha *}. \label{eq:30}\end{equation}Inasmuch as $c^n_*$ contains all simplices of $c^n$, from(\ref{eq:29}) and (\ref{eq:30}) it follows that$$\tilde F^{n-1}_{j*} = \sum_\alpha \tilde F^{n-1}_{j\alpha *},\quad z^{n-1}_{**} = \sum_\alpha z^{n-1}_{\alpha *}$$in reduction mod 2 is transformed, correspondingly, to$\tilde F^{n-1}_j$ and $z^{n-1}$ Due to the choice oforientation of the chains $c^n_{\alpha *}$, $z^{n-1}_{**}$coincides with $z^{n-1}$, and is, consequently, an integralcycle. But then from (\ref{eq:30}) it follows that also$\tilde F^{n-1}_{j*}$ is an integral cycle, which provesthe orientability of $\tilde F^{n-1}_j$.\end{proof}\noindent Submitted 30.VI.1961\begin{thebibliography}{LF}\bibitem[A1]{A1} Aleksandrov, P.
